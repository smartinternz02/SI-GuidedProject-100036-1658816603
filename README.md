Effective Heart Disease Prediction Using IBM Auto AI Service

The following steps has been followed during project: “Effective Heart Disease Prediction Using IBM Auto AI Service”

1. Creation of IBM Watson Studio Project
2. ADD Auto AI Experiment 
3. Upload the Dataset for Machine learning model, You can find the dataset here:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CbJTxD9EhsPBvpZj5qwVtX5WS8yrQ1pB/view?usp=sharing
4. Run the Auto AI Experiment to build a Machine learning model on the desired dataset
5. Save the model.
6. Deploy the model as a web server and generate scoring End Point
7. Creation of IBM Watson Studio and Node-RED Service
8. Creation of a WEB application Using Node-RED to take user input and showcase Prediction on UI.
